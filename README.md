Background - 
The 2023 Nigerian presidential election was held on 25 February 2023, There were 93.4 million eligible voters for February 25 polls, the sixth since Nigeria’s return to democracy in 1999.

Top contenders include Bola Tinubu, a two-term former governor of Lagos(29 May 1999 – 29 May 2007) and a major stalwart of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party as well as the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president who is gunning for the position a record sixth time.

Also in the race are the Labour Party’s (LP) Peter Obi, a two-time former governor of Anambra (14th June 2007 – 17th March 2014), and Rabiu Kwankwaso, ex-defence minister and former governor of the northern hub Kano, on the ticket of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP).

We have decided to do a comparative anlysis between two candidates - Bola Tinubu of APC and Peter Obi OF LP. Both candidates have been two time former governors, therefore this presents us with a good basis to perform the analysis.

Data Collection

We identify the data being used, its limitations and its credibility.
Information on the data being used:
Data was obtained from Global Data Lab (GDL) which is an independent data and research center at the Nijmegen School of Management of Radboud University. The specific dataset used was from the Sub national Human Development Index (SHDI), which is an average of the sub-national values of three dimensions: education, health and standard of living..


Limitations.
---

The dataset presents specific gaps between(1999-2002). Those records will have to be extrapolated in order to fill in gap.
The accuracies of the extrapolated datapoints average about 50%
